# Prediction Of Credit Card Fraud Detection
Problem statement

The objective of this project is to predict the fraudulant credit card transactions and we will build a classification to predict whether a transaction is fraudulant or not.
A credit card is one of the most used financial product for online purchases.It will be a convenient way to manage your financial needs,but also risky.
Credit card fraud refers to the physical loss of credit card or sensitive credit card information.Many machine learning algorithms can be used for detection.This project shows several algorithms that can be used for classifying transactions as fraud or genuine one.Credit card fraud detection data set was used in this project.Because the dataset was highly imbalanced,Under sampling and Over sampling  techniques are used for balancing the dataset.
